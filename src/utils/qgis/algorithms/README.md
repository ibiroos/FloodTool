Utility scripts to set input layers for the FloodTool plug-in:

- **attach.py**: This algorithm searchs for nearest neighbors in other layer and attaches its fields.
- **buffer_from_line.py**: Generates a buffer from a simplified line.
- **line_simplification.py**: A very simple gaussian filter for line simplification.
